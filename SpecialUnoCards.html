<p style="line-break: strict;font-size:3vh"><a id="1"></a>1: Angry Birds (King Pig Card): Choose a color. All other players must take turns drawing cards until a player draws a card of the selected color. You then choose the color of play.<br><br><a id="2"></a>2: Batman (The Joker's 3 Card): You have a total of 3 cards to make other players draw. You may distribute these cards in any manner (i.e. 3 cards to 1 person; 1 card to 3 people; etc.).<br><br><a id="3"></a>3: Care Bears (Care-A-Lot Card): After this card is played, all players (in play order) get to play any card from their hand, ending with the person who played the Care-A-Lot card.

After all players have discarded a card, the player who played the Care-A-Lot card chooses the color of play.<br><br><a id="4"></a>4: Cars (Victory Lap Card): All players pass their cards facedown in the direction of play. The person who played the card looks at the cards passed to her and decides whether to keep the cards or pass them.

She then chooses the color of play.<br><br><a id="5"></a>5: Cars 2 (Special Agent Mater Card): When you play this card, you may look at every other player's hand.<br><br><a id="6"></a>6: Chicago White Sox (Manager Card): Call out a card that you want (e.g. Draw 4).

All players who cannot do so must draw 2 cards.<br><br><a id="14"></a>14: Eragon (Zar'Roc Card): Choose a player and look at his cards.

Both players play a card and the higher number wins (non-number cards are treated as 0s). The loser then draws cards equal to the numerical difference between the two cards.
